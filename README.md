#  MusicBoxApp

The API for music from ![MusicBoxSwift](https://github.com/darkCavalier11/MusicBoxSwift).

The project uses a MVVM pattern. All the view controllers are inside `ViewControllers` directory and all view models inside `ViewModel` directory. There are few core data files to store musics locally and storing application metadata. `CoreDataModels` contain all the coredata files. This is a project for learning and fun.
